# Stat-y Statistics Calculator

The project's goal is to get a single application to provide all statistics functions needed for elementary statistics classes. Other projects exist that can provide the same but they are not easy to use for students. The applications that are easy to use do not have many statistics calculations. This is a multiplatform application aimed at providing all basic functions that can be used in replace of popular graphing calculators. Today it provides some basic functions but I hope to provide all the functions in time.

The project wants to have alpha input which would put factual statistics sentences together. It will have tooltips to support student understanding and make sure the app helps students to understand the context of what they are doing. This feature is something that is completely missing in modern technology in statistics. An example is GOStat <a href='https://github.com/JohnGJackson0/GoStat'>. This is a remake of the application to support multiplatform with the help of flutter.
