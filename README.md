# Stat-y Statistics Calculator

The project's goal is to provide all statistic functions needed for elementary statistics classes. Other projects exist that can provide the same but they are not easy to use for students. The applications that are easy to use do not have all calculations. This is a multiplatform application aimed at replacing graphing calculators for homework or independent study. 

Its second major goal is to provide context. For example, the project wants to have alpha input which would put factual sentences together rather then just outputting a p and t value. It will have tooltips to support understanding. This ability is something that is missing in even the more modern solutions. An example is <a href='https://github.com/JohnGJackson0/GoStat'>Go Stat<a/>. This is a remake of the same to support multiplatform with the help of flutter.
