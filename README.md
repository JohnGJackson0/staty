# Stat-y Statistics Calculator

The project's goal is to get a single application to provide all statistics functions needed for elementary statistics classes. Other projects exist that can provide the same but they are not easy to use for students. The applications that are easy to use do not have many statistics calculations. This is a multiplatform application aimed at providing all basic functions that can be used in replace of popular graphing calculators. Today it provides some basic functions but I hope to provide all the functions in time.

This is a multiplatform application using a single code base with the help of the Flutter Framework. I used bloc for state management and made sure to extend a modular architecture. This means keeping one bloc per screen even at the expense of verbosity as it allows for containers that can be tested in isolation and extended rather than modified.
